#Prediction of Sales of Rossmann Stores using Ensemble of Regressors

The project was an attempt at solving the Machine Learning and Data Mining problems of the real world. The ML Challenge was selected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)

An extensive analysis of the data revealed helpful insights. The data wt hand was transformed accordingly by adding new features, merging correlated features and one-hot encodig of categorical variables. Further, outliers were clipped, and in some cases pruned.

We studied and tried multiple regression modules, including from a Linear Regression using Stochastic Gradient
Descent, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boost and Random Forest. The final model was formulated as an ensemble of bagging and boosting techniques. This was observed to better accommodate the richness in the data and the features yielding
higher accuracy.

This project also served as a course project for CS273A : Introduction to Machine Learning at UCI in Fall 2015.
